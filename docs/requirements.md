## Types of Users

### System Administrator (SYSADMIN)

- Can join tournaments via code
- Can select an existing user during first login/registration, so that they can reuse a user that was created during an import

## Jass Variant: Schieber

- Teams: 2 players per team (2 vs 2)
- Declarations: a team declares trump
- Declarations per player: typically 2 per game (configurable)

## Tournament Structure

### Hierarchy

Tournament
  └── Rounds (default: 5 rounds, configurable)
        └── Pairings (4 players per pairing: 2 vs 2)
                └── Games (default: 8 games per pairing per round, configurable)
              

### Tournaments
- Belong to an organizer
- Can be recurring events
- Reports across all tournaments of an organizer
- Number of rounds configurable (default: 5)
- Number of games per round configurable (default: 8)
- Code for participation can be generated (maybe QR code to scan)
- Match bonus configurable (on/off)

### Rounds
- A pairing of a round consists of multiple games (default: 8)
- New pairings can be defined per round

### Games
- A game = one match between two pairs (2 vs 2)
- Total 157 points per game
- Match bonus: +100 points when a team takes all points, if match bonus is enabled for the tournament
- Existing games follow the current tournament match-bonus setting when the tournament configuration is changed
- Only one team needs to enter points; the other is calculated as (157 - entered points)

### Pairings
- Normal mode: players play individually and pairings change per round
- Alternative: fixed teams for the whole tournament
- Input: manual assignment or automatic draw
- A pairing must have exactly 4 participants (2 per team)
- A pairing must have exactly the configured number of games before it can be completed
- A pairing can only be completed when all its games are completed

### Tournament Participants
- Organizers can register participants manually OR
- Players can add themselves via code
- Same players can participate in different tournaments
- Player identification via email address (for Excel export/matching)

## Features

### Pairing Management
- Organizers can assign pairings manually
- Organizers can run automatic pairing draws
- Players can confirm or enter their assigned partner themselves

### Score Management
- Players can enter scores
- Scores can be hidden during the tournament (for suspense)
- Score visibility can be toggled by the organizer

### Leaderboards
- Players can view leaderboards for tournaments
- Reports across all tournaments of an organizer

### Excel Import
- Primary purpose: import historical tournament data
- Available for: Organizers (for their own tournaments)
- Import includes:
  - Tournament metadata
  - Participant data
  - Game results
  - Pairings
- Player matching via email address
- Details to be specified later
- Enables migration of historical data into the system

## Privacy & Isolation
- SYSADMIN users can see and manage all tournaments.
- Organizers can see tournaments they organize.
- Players can see tournaments in which they are registered as participants.

- Tournaments of different organizers are logically separated, except for SYSADMIN access.
